// Textures: Images/data applied to 3D models
// Material: Computes the look of that surface texture on a geometric surface
// Texture coordinates questions what happens if you sample
// outside of the 0-1 uv range.
// Texture Addressing:
//	- Deals with how to consider coordinates outside of the 0-1 range
//	- We can clamp or repeat the coordinates depending on the addressing
